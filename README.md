# Simple Calculator in Python

Welcome to the Simple Calculator project! This Python-based calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with ease. The program is interactive, user-friendly, and includes additional features like error handling and extra operations to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Operations**: Includes modulus and power operations for more complex calculations.
- **Error Handling**: Handles non-numeric inputs and division/modulus by zero with informative error messages.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Engaging prompts and feedback ensure a pleasant user experience.
- **Custom Output Messages**: Special messages for negative results add a unique touch to the calculator's functionality.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to input two numbers.
2. The user selects an operation from the available choices:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
   - Modulus (`%`)
   - Power (`^`)
3. The calculator performs the chosen operation and displays the result.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the calculator works:

```plaintext
Simple Calculator - Let's do some math!

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3

What operation would you like to perform?
1: Addition (+)
2: Subtraction (-)
3: Multiplication (*)
4: Division (/)
5: Modulus (%)
6: Power (^)

Choose an operation by entering the number (1/2/3/4/5/6): 5

Result: 10 % 3 = 1.0
